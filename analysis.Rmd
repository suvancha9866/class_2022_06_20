```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(billboard)
library(tidyverse)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Which Artist appears the most
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#There are features that are unadressed in our frequencies
x <- wiki_hot_100s |> 
  as_tibble(wiki_hot_100s)
temp <- x |> 
  select(artist) |> 
  group_by(artist) |> 
  summarize(frequency = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(frequency)) |> 
  slice(1)
```
`r temp$artist` is the most appeared artist on the Wiki Top 100s from 1960 to 2016.

How many artists appear on the billboard once?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
temp_1 <- x |> 
  select(artist) |> 
  group_by(artist) |> 
  summarize(frequency = n()) |> 
  arrange(desc(frequency)) |>
  filter(frequency == 1)

nrow(temp_1)
```
`r nrow(temp_1)` is the number of artists who appear once on the billboard 100.

Which year has the most unique artists?
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#I wasn't able to complete this portion of the code.
x |> 
  select(artist, year) |> 
  mutate(year = parse_number(year)) |> 
  group_by(artist) |> 
  summarize(frequency = n(), yearags = year) |> 
  group_by(yearags)

#  group_by(yearags) |> 
 # summarize(frequency = n()) |> 
  
```
